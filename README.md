# CurrentVersion
(c#) Updates csv file with your machine name, date and current OS version (Example)

If you don't have RMM software that informs you are all your computers up to date, you can set this program I created to run on startup via Group Policy to update a csv of all the relevant stats
The csv will be created in the same folder the script is run in 

#Make sure users have access to the folder
